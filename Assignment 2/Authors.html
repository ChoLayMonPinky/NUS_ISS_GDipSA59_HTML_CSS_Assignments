	<p><b>Cho Lay Mon</b>, 27, is the youngest of four family members. With a background in Information Technology from Yangon University of Distance Education and a bachelor degree in Korean from Yangon University of Foreign Languages, I have also earned a Graduate Diploma in Management from the University of London. I have gained extensive experience in data extraction, transformation, and cleaning. Despite a non-IT-centric education, my previous work experience and self-study in IT, including Excel and Power BI, have driven a desire to deepen IT knowledge. When I have free time, I like to listen to music, read books and travel around the world.  </p>
