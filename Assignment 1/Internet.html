    <h3 style="color: #33bbff;font-family: sans-serif;"> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia </h3> 
    
    <p> This &nbsp;&nbsp; article &nbsp;&nbsp; is &nbsp;&nbsp; about &nbsp;&nbsp; the &nbsp;&nbsp; worldwide &nbsp;&nbsp; computer &nbsp;&nbsp; network. For &nbsp;&nbsp; other &nbsp;&nbsp; uses, &nbsp;&nbsp; see Internet 
    (disambiguation). </p>
    
    <p> Not to be confused with the World Wide Web. </p>
    
    <p> The <b>Internet</b> is &nbsp;&nbsp; a &nbsp;&nbsp; global &nbsp;&nbsp; system &nbsp;&nbsp; of &nbsp;&nbsp; interconnected computer &nbsp;&nbsp; networks that &nbsp;&nbsp; use &nbsp;&nbsp; the 
    standard Internet protocol suite(TCP/IP) to link several billion devices worldwide. It is a <i style="color: #ce0637">network of networks </i> that consists of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as &nbsp;&nbsp; the &nbsp;&nbsp; inter-linked hypertext documents &nbsp;&nbsp; and applications of &nbsp;&nbsp; the World &nbsp;&nbsp; Wide &nbsp;&nbsp; Web(WWW), the infrastructure to support email, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing and telephony. </p>
    
    <p>The &nbsp;&nbsp; origins &nbsp;&nbsp; of &nbsp;&nbsp; the &nbsp;&nbsp; Internet &nbsp;&nbsp; date &nbsp;&nbsp; back &nbsp;&nbsp; to &nbsp;&nbsp; research &nbsp;&nbsp; commissioned &nbsp;&nbsp; by &nbsp;&nbsp; the United &nbsp;&nbsp; States government in &nbsp;&nbsp; the &nbsp;&nbsp; 1960s &nbsp;&nbsp; to &nbsp;&nbsp; build &nbsp;&nbsp; robust, &nbsp;&nbsp; fault-tolerant &nbsp;&nbsp; communication &nbsp;&nbsp; via &nbsp;&nbsp; computer networks.[2] This work, combined with work in the United Kingdom and France, led to the primary precursor &nbsp; network, &nbsp; the &nbsp; ARPANET, &nbsp; in &nbsp; the &nbsp; United &nbsp; States. &nbsp; A &nbsp; 1980 &nbsp; paper &nbsp; refers &nbsp; to &nbsp;"the &nbsp; ARPA internet". <span style="color: red;">The interconnection of regional academic networks in the 1980s marks the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet.</span> From the early 1990s, the network experienced sustained exponential &nbsp; growth &nbsp; as &nbsp; generations &nbsp; of &nbsp; institutional, personal, &nbsp; and mobile computers &nbsp; were connected to it. </p>
